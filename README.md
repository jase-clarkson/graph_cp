# Distribution Free Prediction Sets for Node Classification

This repository requires Pytorch with GPU enabled. It also builds on 
Torch Geometric and Torch lightning, both of which should be installed 
with compatible versions from the respective websites. Other requirements can be 
installed from the requirements.txt file.

To run the scripts, run one of the scripts shadow_lightning.py or sage_lightning.py, then copy the experiment directory
from the experiments/ folder into the appropriate jupyter notebook.

NOTE: this repository will de-anonymize upon publication.
